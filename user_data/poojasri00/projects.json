[{"name": "Web Application Penetration Testing", "description": "This project focuses on performing a penetration test (ethical hacking) on a web application to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. Using tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and Nikto, you'll scan a vulnerable web application (such as OWASP Juice Shop) for common security flaws like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR). You will attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary scripts, or manipulate user sessions."}, {"name": "Network Defense with IDS/IPS", "description": "In this project, you will build and configure an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) to monitor and protect a network from potential threats. Using open-source security tools such as Snort or Suricata, you will set up a real-time system that can detect and prevent various types of cyberattacks like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, SQL injections, and unauthorized access attempts. You will also simulate attacks on a test network to evaluate the effectiveness of the IDS/IPS in detecting and preventing threats."}]
